The Lux Empire RP - AI.DOC
Description
The Lux Empire RP - AI.DOC is a comprehensive documentation for the AI Doctor script designed for the Lux Empire RP server.

With the presence of a moving ambulance and a doctor, players can pay for the service and receive help on the spot.

Service Fees: Players are charged a fee for the ambulance service and the assistance provided by the EMS ped.
Safe Driving: The ped drives the ambulance responsibly and avoids reckless driving.

Framework Compatibility: The script is compatible with both ESX and QB frameworks, automatically adapting to the server's chosen framework.
